# Software Design / Overview

**This documentation will be updated as more details about the StateMod code and design are included in
the Developer Documentation.**

The StateMod Fortran code is divided into separate files with `.for` extension.
Each subroutine is in a separate file and the name of the file generally matches the subroutine or function.
See also the following resources:

* [Code list](../code-list/code-list) - list of all code files
* [Resources](../resources/resources) - developer training documentation, flowcharts, etc.

Need to describe code modules at a high level:

* Main entry point (see: [`statem.for`](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/cdss-app-statemod-fortran/blob/master/src/main/fortran/statem.for))
* Code organization:  include files, parameter data, etc.
* Input
* Initialization
	+ Global data
	+ Main program data
* Calculations
* Output
* Data checks
* Logging
* Clean-up
* Integration with StateMod GUI
* etc.

## StateMod Code API ##

It is possible to process the StateMod code with Doxygen software to produce HTML documentation
and call diagrams.
However, it is not clear if this approach will be a standard part of development.
See the following resources:

* [Example StateMod 15x experimental code documentation generated by Doxygen](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/cdss/statemod/16.00.00/doc-api/index.html)
* [Initial Doxygen setup](../../project-init/doc-doxygen/)
