# Initial Project Setup / Documentation, User (MkDocs)

StateMod documentation has traditionally been maintained in a single large PDF document generated from 
Microsoft Word files.

A separate repository

has been create for User Documentation.

See the [Development Tasks](../dev-tasks/documenting.md) for information about processing Word documentation.
