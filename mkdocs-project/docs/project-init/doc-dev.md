# Initial Project Setup / Documentation, Developer (MkDocs)

A MkDocs project (this documentation) was created in order to document initial project setup.
Typical MkDocs guidelines were followed.
See the [repository README](https://github.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-app-statemod-fortran-doc-dev) for more information.

See the [Development Tasks](../dev-tasks/documenting.md) for information about using MkDocs.
