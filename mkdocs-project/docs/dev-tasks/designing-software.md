# Development Tasks / Designing Software

New StateMod feature requests often originate from modelers that need new functionality to complete projects.
A process has been implemented to use GitHub issues to define new requests.
See the following:

* [OpenCDSS StateMod protocol for issues](http://learn.openwaterfoundation.org/cdss-website-opencdss/statemod/statemod/#adding-an-issue)
* StateMod [Software Design](../software-design/overview.md) documentation.
